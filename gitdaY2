Git presentation questions 

Here are **brief explanations** for each of your Git-related (and a few networking-related) questions, with examples where helpful.

1. **Difference between revert and reset**  
   `git revert` creates a **new commit** that undoes the changes of a previous commit (safe for shared/public branches; history preserved).  
   `git reset` moves the branch pointer backward (rewrites history; can be dangerous on shared branches).  
   - Revert: `git revert HEAD~1` → new commit undoing last change.  
   - Reset: `git reset --hard HEAD~1` → discards last commit completely (use --soft or --mixed to keep changes).

2. **What is cp -p used for?**  
   `cp -p` copies files while **preserving** attributes like timestamps, ownership, and permissions (same as `cp --preserve`).  
   Example: `cp -p script.sh /backup/` → copied file keeps original modification time & permissions.

3. **What is git fetch?**  
   Downloads latest commits, branches, and tags from remote repository to your local repo **without merging** them into your working branch. Safe way to see remote changes first.  
   Example: `git fetch origin` → updates remote-tracking branches like `origin/main`.

4. **What happens internally when you run git init?**  
   Creates a new empty Git repository by making a hidden `.git` folder in the current directory. This folder contains:  
   - objects/ (commits, trees, blobs)  
   - refs/ (branches, tags)  
   - HEAD file  
   - config, description, hooks, info, etc.  
   Nothing is tracked yet until you `add` and `commit`.

5. **How to change commit message?**  
   For the **last commit** (not pushed): `git commit --amend` (opens editor) or `git commit --amend -m "New message"`.  
   For older commits: use interactive rebase `git rebase -i HEAD~n` and change `pick` to `reword`.

6. **How to change last commit ID?**  
   Any change to a commit (message, files) creates a **new commit hash** (SHA). Use `git commit --amend` (changes files or message) → new ID.  
   Example: `git commit --amend --no-edit` (just touch files → new hash).

7. **What is commit ID amend?**  
   Refers to amending the last commit with `git commit --amend`, which creates a **new commit** with a **new ID** (old one is replaced in history). Useful for fixing typos or adding forgotten files.

8. **Difference between git pull and git fetch**  
   `git fetch` → downloads remote changes (commits/branches) but **does not merge** (safe to review first).  
   `git pull` → does `fetch` + `merge` (or rebase if configured) automatically into current branch.  
   Fetch first → review → merge is safer.

9. **Difference between git clone and git fork**  
   `git clone` → creates a **local copy** of a repo (you can push back if you have permission).  
   `git fork` → creates your own **copy on GitHub/GitLab** (remote copy under your account; used for contributing via pull requests).  
   Typical flow: fork → clone your fork → work → push → pull request.

10. **How to resolve merge conflict?**  
    Git marks conflicts in files with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`.  
    Steps:  
    - Open conflicting files  
    - Edit to keep desired changes  
    - `git add <file>`  
    - `git commit` (or continue rebase/merge)  
    Use tools like VS Code, Meld, or `git mergetool`.

11. **How to identify last commit ID?**  
    `git log -1` or `git rev-parse HEAD` → shows the current HEAD commit hash.  
    Short version: `git log --oneline -1`.

12. **In 100 files need only 40 using Git**  
    You want to commit or stage only 40 out of 100 changed files.  
    - Interactive: `git add -p` (stage hunks one by one)  
    - Selective: `git add file1.js file2.py ...` (list 40 files)  
    - Or `git add :/` then `git reset` unwanted ones.

13. **Difference between git pull and git push**  
    `git pull` → fetches remote changes + merges them locally (download + integrate).  
    `git push` → sends your local commits to remote (upload).  
    Pull = get updates; push = share your work.

14. **Difference between git clone and git init**  
    `git init` → creates a **new empty repository** locally (no remote yet).  
    `git clone <url>` → copies an **existing remote repository** locally (includes history, branches, remote tracking).

15. **After git init what folders are created?**  
    Only one hidden folder: `.git/`  
    Inside `.git/`:  
    - branches/  
    - hooks/  
    - info/  
    - objects/  
    - refs/  
    - config, HEAD, description, etc.

16. **What is centralized version control?**  
    Single central server stores all code/history (e.g., SVN, CVS, old Perforce).  
    All users commit directly to central repo; requires constant network.  
    Git is **distributed** — everyone has full copy.

17. **TCP and UDP listening ports**  
    TCP → connection-oriented (reliable, ordered): HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), SSH (22), FTP (21).  
    UDP → connectionless (faster, no guarantee): DNS (53), DHCP (67/68), streaming/video.

18. **What is HTTP 503 error?**  
    Service Unavailable — server is temporarily down or overloaded (maintenance, too many requests).  
    Client should retry later.

19. **What is a server?**  
    Computer/program that provides services/resources to clients over network (web server, database server, file server).  
    Listens on ports, responds to requests (e.g., Apache/Nginx for HTTP).

20. **What is SFTP and its port number?**  
    SSH File Transfer Protocol — secure file transfer over SSH (encrypted).  
    Port: **22** (same as SSH).

21. **What is git checkout?**  
    Switches branches or restores files.  
    - `git checkout main` → switch to branch  
    - `git checkout -- file.txt` → discard changes in file  
    Modern: prefer `git switch` for branches, `git restore` for files.

22. **What are Git Tokens?**  
    Personal Access Tokens (PATs) — secure alternatives to passwords for Git authentication (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).  
    Used for `git push`, CI/CD, scripts. Generate in account settings.

23. **What is Pull Request and its process?**  
    Proposal to merge changes from one branch/fork into another (usually main).  
    Process: fork → clone → branch → commit → push → create PR → review → merge.

24. **What is Merge Request?**  
    Same as Pull Request — GitLab term for it (GitHub calls it PR, GitLab calls it MR).

25. **What is git fetch?** (repeated)  
    Downloads remote changes without merging (see #3).

26. **PRC means**  
    In Git context — likely typo/misspelling of **PR** = Pull Request (or Merge Request).  
    (Not standard abbreviation otherwise.)

27. **What happens if you delete .git folder?**  
    Repository is destroyed. All history, branches, commits, tags are lost forever (locally).  
    Working files remain, but no version control anymore.

28. **How to install Git in MobaXterm?**  
    MobaXterm usually includes Git.  
    If missing: Plugins → Install plugin → search "Git" or use package manager: `apt-get install git` (in Mobaxterm's Cygwin-like env).  
    Or download from git-scm.com and add to PATH.

29. **How to switch one branch to another?**  
    `git switch <branch-name>` (modern) or `git checkout <branch-name>`.  
    Example: `git switch feature/login`.

30. **What is git cherry-pick?**  
    Applies the changes from **specific commit(s)** to current branch (without merging whole branch).  
    Example: `git cherry-pick abc1234` → brings that commit's changes as new commit.

31. **How to check deleted logs?**  
    Use `git reflog` → shows history of HEAD movements (including "lost" commits after reset/rebase).  
    Recover: `git reset --hard HEAD@{n}` or `git cherry-pick <hash>`.

32. **What is Git fork?**  
    Creates your own copy of someone else's repository on GitHub/GitLab (under your account).  
    Used to contribute safely via pull requests.

33. **What is Git reflog?**  
    Local log of where HEAD and branches pointed recently (commits, checkouts, resets, etc.).  
    Helps recover "lost" commits. View: `git reflog` (expires after ~90 days).

34. **How do you resolve merge conflict?** (repeated)  
    See #10 — edit files, resolve markers, `git add`, commit.

35. **How to identify old and new data in conflict?**  
    In conflict file:  
    `<<<<<<< HEAD` → your current branch changes  
    `=======` separator  
    `>>>>>>> branch-name` → incoming changes  
    Edit to keep what you want.

36. **How to create a repository?**  
    - Locally: `git init`  
    - On GitHub/GitLab: click "New repository" → name → create → then `git remote add origin <url>` and push.

37. **What is soft reset and hard reset?**  
    `git reset --soft <commit>` → moves branch pointer; keeps changes staged.  
    `git reset --hard <commit>` → moves pointer + discards all changes in index & working directory (dangerous).  
    (There's also --mixed: default, unstages changes.)
